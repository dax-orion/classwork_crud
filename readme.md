# Classwork on CRUD

A simple website for a company offering cooking classes. Implements simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for subscriber, user, and course entities.

# Usage

Before you begin, MongoDB should be installed and running on your computer/the server

```
npm install
npm start
```

Note: As of right now, the run script relies on [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) being installed globally, get it with:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```
